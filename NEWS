#### v.0.2.1.907 (11/04/17) ####

Changes:
- Updated some of the documentation so it includes details about parameter order of S-Gompertz

Bugfixes:
- In diffusion() When providing w, pval length was not using the right parameter

#### v.0.2.1.906 (10/04/17) ####

Changes:
Replaced if statements with switches where necessary - closing Issue #1
Updated the optimisation process. This should give better results but still not perfect
Added better commented for diffusionPlot() function - closing Issue #2
Open tasks in News depreciated and now tracking them with Issues on github
All the parameter optimisation are now using Subplex algorithm from the nloptr package

Bugfixes:
Several small variable name errors due to the integration

#### v.0.2.0.905 (05/04/17) ####
Changes:
Introducing shifted-gompertz model to the diffusion() function

Bugfixes:
Some typo in the print out function fixed
carstock.RData file should now be available

#### v.0.1.0.904 (30/03/17) ####
Changes:
Depreciating funciton Bass() and Gompertz()
Introducing function diffusion() and seqdiffusion (kindly donated by N. Kourentzes)
  - allows for p-value estimation and sequential generation fitting
  - includes plotting
  - allows forecasting
Added dataset safari
Added dataset windows

#### v.0.0.0.903 (25/03/17) ####
Changes:
